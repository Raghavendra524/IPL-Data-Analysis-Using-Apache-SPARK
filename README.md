## Technologies Used:

Databricks, Apache Spark, AWS S3, SQL, Python, Visualization Tools (Matplotlib).

## step by step process
1. Data Ingestion: Utilized AWS S3 for scalable and secure storage of the IPL dataset.

2. Data Transformation: Implemented Apache Spark in the Databricks environment to perform data transformations, including data cleaning, processing, and aggregation of IPL data.

3. SQL Analytics: Executed SQL queries on the transformed data to conduct detailed analysis, uncovering patterns such as player performance, team statistics, and match outcomes.

4. Data Visualization: Generated insightful visualizations and dashboards to represent the analytical findings.
